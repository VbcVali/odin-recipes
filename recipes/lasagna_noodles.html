    <h1>Homemade Lasagna Sheets</h1>
    <p>
        Homemade lasagna noodles are easier to make than you think and you don't
        even need a pasta machine. And forget about blanching the sheets before
        baking -- no precooking is required!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 cupsItalian-style tipo 00 flour, plus additionar for dusting</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Place flour on a marble or wooden work surface.
            Make a well in the center and crack in eggs; add salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            Gently beat eggs using a fork, incorporating surrounding flour, until
            mixture is runny. Bring remaining flour into the mixture using a bench
            scraper until sough forms a ball. Mix in water, 1 tablespoon at a time, if
            dough feels to stiff.
        </li>
        <li>
            Knead dough with your hands by flattening, streching it, and folding
            the top towards the center. turn 45 degrees and repeat until dough is
            soft and smooth, about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Divide dough into 3 equal portions. Take one piece and flatten it a bit
            with your hands. Dust a work surface with flour and roll dough out using
            a rolling pin 5 to 6 times. turn dough 45 degrees and roll out again, 5 to
            6 times. Keep rolling and turning in the same way until dough is evenly
            very thin. When you hold up the dough, you should be able to see your
            fingers through it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cut pasta dough into rectangular sheets to fit your baking dish using a
            pastry wheel or a knife. Transfer lasagna sheets to a floured kitchen
            towel and let air-dry for about 30 minutes before assembling.
        </li>
